# Analog Notes
Notes for Analog Electronic Circuits [EE21205] of Autumn 2022-23

#
Hello. I know I generally upload codes, but this is convenient to use when it comes to adding stuff (one of the very few things I got to learn from SigSys class)

PS: The book is also in this repository.
_I know my handwriting is... please don't kill me for that_

### Contents:
- **Week 1:**
	- Amplifier model(s)
	- Low pass filter
- **Week 2:** 
	- Semiconductors
	- Extrinsic Semiconductors (p-type and n-type)
	- Diode: Junction Properties (current, voltage, diffusion, capacitance)
	- Bipolar Junction Diodes (BJT)
		- Models and Circuit Diagrams
		- Active Mode of Operation
		- Saturated Mode of Operation
- **Week 3:** 
	- Metal Oxide Semiconductors (MOS) Field Effect Transistors [MOSFET]: Structure
	- Enhancement-type MOSFET: Charge and Capacitive properties
	- Operation in Enhancement type (briefly)
	- Depletion-type MOSFET
> _Note: There was only one class in this week. Hence, the content in the notes might be a bit more than what was taught in the class (this was done in an effort to understand it better only, no weird masochism and stuff)_
- **Week 4:**
	- Operation in Enhancement type: Triode and Saturation modes.
	- Body effect and breakdown
	- Transistor Amplifier models: MOSFET and BJT
	- Small amplitude equivalent models
- **Week 5:**
	- Biasing methods
	- Equivalent Models of amplifiers
> _Note: Questions done in the class are not added here. They will be added if necessary._
